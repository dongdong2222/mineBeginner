async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function is about mining a wood log using a wooden axe. It first checks if a wooden axe is in the inventory, and if not, it mines three more oak logs. Then, it explores the environment randomly until finding a wood log block from a specific list of wood log types. Once a wood log block is found, it mines one wood log block using the wooden axe and sends a chat message confirming the action.
